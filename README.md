Work-in-progress cocotb demos
=============================

This repository contains work-in-progress code introducing various features of
cocotb. The code here is being developed to accompany various cocotb tutorials.
Generally, the focus is on code that is easy to explain; this isn't necessarily
the code that is shortest, most sophisticated or most generalized.

Please open a pull request if you see something that could be improved.
